# Paint Project

The Paint project is a Java application that simulates a simple drawing program. It allows users to create basic drawings on a grid-based background.

## Key Features

- **Draw:** Use arrow keys to move the "brush" (represented by a pink rectangle) across the background. The program respects the grid boundaries and enables you to create lines as you move.
- **Paint:** Press the "P" key to leave a black mark at the current location of the "brush."
- **Clear:** Press the "C" key to remove a previously painted black mark.
- **Save:** Press the "S" key to save your drawing to a text file.
- **Load:** Press the "L" key to load a previously saved drawing from a text file.

# Chatbot Project

Welcome to my chatbot project! This project consists of a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based chatbot interface that interacts with users and generates responses using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of the chatbot.

## Features

- User-friendly chatbot interface.
- Ability to send and receive messages.
- Automatic response generation using OpenAI GPT-3.5 model.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CatarinaBrandao/CBrandao
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the chatbot interface.

## Usage

1. Open the chatbot interface by clicking on the chatbot icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.

2. Type your message in the input field at the bottom of the chat interface and press "Enter" to send the message.

3. The chatbot will display a "Thinking..." message while generating a response using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model.

4. Once the response is generated, it will appear in the chat interface.

5. You can toggle the chatbot interface by clicking the chatbot icon again or by using the close button.

## Customization

- **Styling**: You can customize the appearance of the chatbot by modifying the `style.css` file. Feel free to change colors, fonts, and other design elements to match your preferences.

- **API Key**: To use the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model for response generation, you need to replace the `API_KEY` in the JavaScript code with your own valid OpenAI API key.
